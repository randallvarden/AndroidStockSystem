# AndroidStockSystem
The android application that I have created is a stock management system. The user logs into the application where they can add the stock details such as the cost price, selling price, quantity and the product name. The user is also able to update, delete and view all the stock that is stored within the database. All of the information is stored on a SQLite database. This will assist the owner of keeping track of the products that they purchase from the supplier and will remove the problem of incorrect data entry because of the error handling within the application.
